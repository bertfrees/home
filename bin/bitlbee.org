Configuration:

- [X] connect with slack
  - run ~plugins~ in &bitlbee channel: should list slack
  - run ~account add slack bertfrees@gmail.com%daisy-dev.slack.com PASSWORD~
    - ~account 0 on~ to login (happens automatically on ~identify~)
    - if this doesn't work: ~account add slack U064KJ0HK%daisy-dev.slack.com PASSWORD~
      - see https://github.com/dylex/slack-libpurple?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication
  - test with ~/query slackbot~
  - ~chat add slack #pipeline2~
  - ~/join #pipeline2~
  - ~channel pipeline2 set auto_join true~
- [-] connect with facebook (does not work!)
  - https://wiki.bitlbee.org/HowtoFacebookMQTT
  - ~plugin~ in &bitlbee should list facebook
  - account add facebook bertfrees@hotmail.com 4Xz0jhK2pr
  - (account facebook set token <token from Python script above>)
    - only if 2FA is activated, but does not seem to be the case
  - account facebook on
- [X] ~register <password>~
- [ ] connect with discord
  - https://github.com/sm00th/bitlbee-discord
  - https://aliquote.org/post/discord-bitlbee/
  - [ ] install with [[file:~/Makefile.org::*Bitlbee][~/Makefile]]
- [ ] connect with matrix
  - solutions that replace bitlbee
    - https://git.sr.ht/~emerson/reflectionircd
    - https://github.com/progval/matrix2051
    - https://github.com/martinetd/matrirc
  - no solution with bitblee?

* TODO switch to Matrix instead!

Benefits:

- Matrix is more modern, has an iPhone client, etc.
- Matrix provides unlimited chat history
- Matrix has bridges to all other chat services, bitlbee hasn't
  - this includes IRC
    - https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/irc/
    - connecting to IRC through Matrix can replace a IRC bouncer
      - relevant for [[file:~/Dropbox/org/pipeline/todo.org::*action items tactile reading conference amsterdam][liblouis chat bot]]
- Matrix has a nice Emacs client
  - https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el
- Matrix can be used from any IRC client (see above)

Downsides:

- Need to self-host a server in order to get bridges
